## Project Overview
This Python program generates different polygon-based artworks using the turtle graphics library.  
You can choose from 1-9 of art, each using triangles, squares, pentagons, or random combinations with the golden ratio for aesthetic effects.

## How to Run 
1. make sure turtle library is available  
2. run the program
3. enter a number between 1 and 9 when prompted to generate the corresponding artwork.

for example you put 3 → the code will generates and draw turtle art type 3.

The drawing will appear in a new Turtle graphics window.

## Method
- Generates polygons with random size, orientation, location, color, and border thickness
- Implements golden ratio-based nested polygons for artistic effects.
- Offers 9 predefined art styles.
